## About the Project

# ALXFlix

I created **ALXFlix** primarily as a learning experience to improve my ability to communicate with API databases, practice fetching data, and dive deeper into JavaScript promises. My goal was to challenge myself by building a large-scale project using React.js independently.

However, **ALXFlix** became much more than just a learning project. I focused on making it both user-friendly and visually appealing. The platform not only showcases the newest and top-rated movies or series, but it also features a customizable **My List**, allowing users to save content based on their preferences. This list is stored using LocalStorage, ensuring that saved data remains intact across browser sessions without an expiration date.

To bring **ALXFlix** to life, I utilized:

- **React.js components** for structuring the app
- **SCSS** for responsive styling
- **Vite** for build optimization
- **Context API** to manage global state
- **LocalStorage** for persistent data storage in **My List**
- **Styled Components** (via npm) for dynamic carousels on the homepage
- **Material UI** to create modals with detailed descriptions of each movie/series, including links to trailers on YouTube
